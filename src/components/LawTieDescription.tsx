      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-6">Law-Tie: Bridging Ambition and Justice</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Law-Tie</strong> is an innovative platform that connects individuals in need of legal
        assistance with ambitious student lawyers and law-related professionals. Traditionally,
        people with financial difficulties have had to rely on low-paid pro bono lawyers with limited
        incentives. Law-Tie changes this dynamic by offering them motivated students who are eager to
        gain experience, dedicated to their cases, and carefully selected according to high standards.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Who Can Join</h2>
      <p>
        All professionals on Law-Tie must be students, no further along than the PhD level. Admission
        to the platform is selective and based on:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>Academic record and grade scores</li>
        <li>Relevant previous experience</li>
        <li>A strong and updated resume</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Participants may include:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>Student lawyers</li>
        <li>
          Court-related professionals such as psychologists, social service assistants, journalists,
          environmental engineers, and others connected to the legal field.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Businesses, which may register as:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>
          <strong>Partners</strong>, selecting from different business plans (trial, basic, or
          premium)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sponsors</strong>, offering higher-level support in exchange for premium benefits
          and access to top-performing students.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">The Star Score System</h2>
      <p>
        Performance is tracked through a unique Star Score system. Each time a student team takes on
        a case, their score is updated to reflect:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>The outcome of the case (win or loss)</li>
        <li>The difficulty and influence of the case</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Star Score is not just a measure of success; it highlights the quality of performance
        under different circumstances. Students with higher scores receive more visibility and
        recognition on the platform, making them more attractive to users and sponsors alike.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Professional Profiles and Sponsor Links</h2>
      <p>When creating their profiles, students must:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>Indicate their areas of legal and professional interest</li>
        <li>Select which sponsors they are particularly interested in working with</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        At the end of every semester, Law-Tie generates a ranking of the Top 10 highest-scoring
        students for each sponsor. These students are guaranteed a final-round interview with the
        corresponding sponsor, ensuring a tangible career pathway.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
        Why Students Are More Dedicated than Traditional Pro Bono Lawyers
      </h2>
      <p>
        Law-Tie provides a fresh alternative to traditional pro bono services. Student professionals
        bring a unique combination of motivation and commitment:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>Eagerness for real-world legal experience</li>
        <li>A stronger personal connection with clients due to their younger age</li>
        <li>Ambition to build strong resumes for future careers</li>
        <li>The prospect of high-level job placements in law firms and businesses</li>
        <li>A transparent, objective record of accomplishments via the Star Score system</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Mentorship and Support</h2>
      <p>
        Recognizing that participants are still students, Law-Tie builds mentorship directly into the
        system:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>
          For their first case, every student receives one month of free private mentoring sessions
          with a senior professional. Meetings can be scheduled as often as necessary during this
          period.
        </li>
        <li>After this initial month, mentoring may continue but only as a paid service.</li>
        <li>
          A free, ongoing support channel is available, run by experienced lawyers in Law-Tie, where
          students can ask questions and seek guidance.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This structure ensures that students are not only motivated but also properly supported as
        they grow.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Benefits for Users (Clients)</h2>
      <p>
        For clients, Law-Tie is a free service, provided they pass financial eligibility checks.
        Unlike other pro bono systems, however, Law-Tie emphasizes detailed case-matching, ensuring
        that users are paired with the professional most suited to their needs.
      </p>
      <p>To make this process smooth:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>Financial and personal situations must be described in detail for better matches.</li>
        <li>
          A 24/7 AI chatbox called Cedar helps transform everyday language into precise legal
          terminology, making it easier to match clients with the right professionals.
        </li>
        <li>
          All pairing requests must be answered within 48 business hours, ensuring efficiency and
          urgency.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each client builds a profile page, where all past cases are recorded alongside the
          professionals they worked with.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Feedback System</h2>
      <p>Transparency is key to Law-Tie. After each case:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>Clients must complete a survey and give feedback on the professional’s service.</li>
        <li>Students must also provide feedback about the collaboration.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These reviews are linked to each profile, guiding future matches and ensuring accountability.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Waitlist and Case Management</h2>
      <p>If a client’s best-match professional is unavailable, they can join a waitlist.</p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>
          The waitlist shows an estimated waiting time, but this may change due to complications in
          ongoing cases.
        </li>
        <li>Clients are updated regularly and may choose to remain or proceed with the next match.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once a match is confirmed:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>
          A first appointment is organized between the client, the Law-Tie team, and the
          professionals collaborating on the case.
        </li>
        <li>
          This initial meeting may take place online if participants are in different locations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Official lawyer meetings are expected to take place in-person, depending on the case.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Importantly, no case is initiated unless full coverage of the client’s needs is guaranteed,
        ensuring a reliable and fair system.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Companies and Sponsorships</h2>
      <p>Law-Tie collaborates with companies in two categories: Partners and Sponsors.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Partners</h3>

        <li>A Basic Business Plan</li>
        <li>A Premium Business Plan</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All plans grant access to the Top 10 highest-scoring students interested in their firm.
        Premium plans primarily differ by offering discounted rates for longer commitments.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Sponsors</h3>

      </ul>
